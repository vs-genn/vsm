function [Tfil] = vsm_filter(T,type)

% VSM_FILTER  Reproduces the temperature pre-filtering from the FORTRAN version
%             of the Vaganov-Shashkin model
%
%     [Tfil] = vsm_filter(T,type)
%   
% The original FORTRAN version of the Vaganov-Shashkin model contained a 
% submodule to prefilter (smooth) the daily temperature data.  This function attempts to
% mimic that module to allow the daily temperature data to be similarly smoothed
% prior to being used as input to VSM.
%
% Input:
%  T = matrix (day x year) of temperature data to be filtered
%  type = (string) type of filter, matching choices from the FORTRAN version
%               'V' = low, low pass half filter
%               'L' = low pass half filter
%               'A' = a seven-day moving average
% Output:
%  Tfil = filter temperature series
